So for a while I've been wanting to find a way for the Home Assistant Companion app to be my default home screen.

As much as there's the Fully Kiosk range, at the time it didn't make sense for me to purchase the app, and that's there HASSLauncher was made, I first saw the idea in the Home Assistant forum, and finally drove myself insane enough to start and finish the
project, and it works great.

The APK is signed with a certificate.

with newer Android versions, Google Play will scan the app to ensure that it is safe enough to install, in which it does succeed, so rest assured, the app is safe to use.

The app locates the Home Assistant App on your device and launches it, you can even choose it as the default home app in the default app settings, if the Home Assistant app isn't installed, it will open up the Google Play Store page for you to install the app.

Hope you guys enjoy this one.
P.S.: This app runs on Android 5.0 and later.
